Your application has been carefully reviewed by the Graduate Admissions Committee of the Physics graduate program and by the Office of Graduate Studies. I regret to inform you that your application for graduate study at UC Davis for Fall Quarter 2014 was not approved.

Each year, the number of highly qualified applicants far exceeds the available openings in our graduate programs. For this reason, graduate programs must be very selective in making their admission decisions. Each decision is based on a comprehensive review of the applicant's file. Some of the factors taken into consideration include: prior academic record and preparation for advanced study in the selected field; examination scores and other submitted materials; completion of program admissions requirements including prerequisite coursework; ability of the program to provide curricular and/or research opportunities consistent with the applicant's stated educational objectives; and completeness of the applicant's file.

The program to which you applied indicated the following as the reason(s) that you were not selected for admission:
Academic work is not as competitive as that of other applicants.
If you have any questions regarding the reasons for your denial, you may contact the admissions adviser of the Physics graduate program. Thank you once again for your interest in pursuing graduate education at UC Davis. If in the future you believe that your accomplishments may be competitive, please do not hesitate to reapply. I wish you every success in achieving your educational objectives.
